### **Building Tomorrow's Singapore**

The theme and approach for Pre-U Seminar 2020 take reference from recent national directions and issues of concern.  In January 2019, at the launch of the Singapore Bicentennial, Prime Minister (PM) Lee Hsien Loong said, “For we are never done building Singapore. It is every generation’s duty to keep on building, for our children, and for our future.”  In June 2019, Deputy Prime Minister (DPM) Heng Swee Keat shared on the use of a consultative approach through the national conversation, “Singapore Together” (“SG Together”), where the fourth generation (4G) leadership would be partnering the people to help shape Singapore’s shared future, and to engender a strong sense of belonging amongst Singaporeans.

In the National Day Rally (NDR) address in August 2019, PM Lee highlighted a few key issues affecting Singapore, such as climate change, the cost of education as well as retirement age in relation to an ageing population.  At the recent Singapore Summit in September 2019, DPM Heng addressed issues on widening inequality, the growing intergenerational divide and deepening political polarisation. He spoke on the fraying of the social compact that held societies together as well as how technology had exacerbated these divisions.
  
PM Lee concluded the NDR 2019 with “Let us strive together to create this future. Let us unite as one nation to build tomorrow’s Singapore”.  This last line and the essence of various key speeches will provide much inspiration for the participants of Pre-University Seminar 2020 to share their hopes and aspirations for Singapore and discuss how they can play a part in nation-building, in the process strengthening their sense of belonging to Singapore.

Therefore, we propose that the theme of Pre-University Seminar 2020 be ‘Building Tomorrow’s Singapore’.  First, the theme focuses the participants on envisioning a future for Singapore while reflecting on the values and fundamentals that have brought Singapore to where it is today.  Participants will examine the relevance of these values in nation-building, as we navigate an increasingly complex and volatile world.  Second, the theme encourages participants to communicate their hopes and aspirations for Singapore’s future.  Participants will discuss the opportunities and challenges that Singapore faces, and consider the trade-offs that have to be made when implementing policies and finding solutions to these issues.
