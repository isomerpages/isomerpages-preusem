### **A Strong and Resilient Nation**

This sub-theme will explore the concept of social cohesion and inclusion in multi-cultural Singapore.  It has become important for Singaporeans to revisit our social compact and adopt a shared responsibility to look out for those who are more vulnerable.  Participants will explore ways in which Singapore can become a more cohesive and inclusive society, thereby strengthening our community bonds and re-affirming our national identity.
