### **A Vibrant and Liveable City**

This sub-theme will explore how Singapore can continue to be a vibrant and liveable city for all.  To ensure that Singaporeans continue to enjoy a good quality of life, we must find ways to address some pressing issues.  For example, climate change is one of the greatest challenges for the world, and Singapore must find equitable and sustainable ways to tackle this problem.
