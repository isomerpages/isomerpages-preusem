### **Let our Reimagi:Nation Soar!**

“Project Reimagi:Nation” was inspired by PM Lee Hsien Loong’s 2018 National Day Message in which he challenged all Singaporeans to “reimagine Singapore” by “planning boldly and creatively”.

As future leaders embarking on this Pre-U Seminar journey to reimagine Singapore 4.0, each Area-of-Focus (AOF) group is invited to propose 3 Learning Destinations (LDs) that they hope to visit in order for the group to trial, test, introduce or present their creative idea. This visit to the LDs would benefit the AOF groups with the invaluable feedback, knowledge and experience from their host(s) - all of which the groups can then critically reflect and work upon, to refine their creative ideas for Singapore 4.0.

The team of Special Programme teachers will do their best to connect the AOF groups with their preferred LDs or recommend alternatives that best complement the purpose and intent of their “Project Reimagi:Nation”. This visit to the LDs will take place on the afternoon of 3 June 2019 (Mon), Day 1 of Pre-U Seminar 2019.

To commemorate the Pre-U Seminar 2019 journey between March and June 2019, each AOF group is to capture photographic snapshots of their shared moments and milestones as they document the evolution of their "Project Reimagi;Nation".  All 22 AOF groups will have a special moment during the Pre-U Seminar 2019 Closing Ceremony to present their gift to Singapore 4.0, alongside their curated snapshot-memories, forming the “Project Reimagi:Nation" Finale Montage!

So let's DREAM! 
Let's come alongside each other and let our Reimagi:Nation soar!
