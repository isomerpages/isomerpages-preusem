### **Project DeSiGn!**

The Singapore Conversations in 2013 and the current “SG Together” efforts illustrate how the government and public service recognise the importance of involving citizens and diverse stakeholders in their engagement efforts.  Public agencies are finding the need to move towards a “co” paradigm or framework where users (citizens) and providers (public agencies) are co-creating solutions, with each contributing capabilities to ideation, policy formulation and solution implementation.   As our people increasingly aspire to be involved in the co-creation of policies, the Pre-University Seminar can be a good platform to sensitise our students to a responsible and constructive process to do so.

Design Thinking (DT) for Social Innovation (SI) will be our main approach to scaffold participants’ learning for Pre-University Seminar 2020.  Traditionally, designers have focused on enhancing the look and functionality of products. Recently, the use of DT has moved to tackling more complex, social and people-centric problems.  In Singapore, DT for SI is taught in some schools and local institutes such as the SUTD-MIT International Design Centre. 

Participants’ discussions and solutioning will culminate in Project DeSiGn, a team project curated in a presentation and display at the Closing Ceremony.  Project DeSiGn signifies our youth’s aspiration to ‘build tomorrow’s Singapore’.  The Design Challenge is to “Design solution(s) that will meet the needs of the user(s) in [your area of focus].”  This learning experience aims to strengthen participants’ sense of belonging to Singapore.  

Participants will also have the opportunity to gather feedback from resource persons, including expert interviewees and panellists.
